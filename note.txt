Install cmigemo:
Windows: Download from KaoriYa
Linux: sudo apt-get install cmigemo
macOS: brew install cmigemo
Run TWF and check logs for "Migemo search enabled"
Use search mode (Ctrl+S) with romaji to find Japanese files

---

Non-Reloadable Settings (Requires Restart)
Migemo: Dictionary path and enabled status.
Logging: Log level and providers.

**done**
at starting background job, put jobid(guid) on taskpanel: sample "[Tab 1:] Copy to test2: Started - JobID:0f8fad5b-d9cb-469f-a165-70867728950e"

when deleteing a directory "delete 1 file(s) " dialog is shown. should use proper name and pluralization:
- when deleting file : "1 file"  "2 files"
- when deleting directory : "1 directory" "2 directories"
- when deleting 1 file and 2 directories : "2 directories, 1 file"

viewing large files takes time.
change textviewer, and binaryviewer(may be independent from textviewer so that i can enhance features):
* a high-performance text/binary viewer for massive files (GB+) that uses memory-mapped files, lazy loading
  with chunked reading (1-4MB), virtual scrolling, caching strategy (LRU), async I/O, line indexing for text files,
  efficient data structures (rope/gap buffers), optimized search (Boyer-Moore), UI optimization (double-buffering),
  configurable limits, file type detection, and background processing to ensure responsive operation with large
  files.
* "Esc to stop reading" in taskpanel or asynchronous dialog(continue/cancel) if it takes >10 sec, and allow stop reading 


---
**to be fixed**

* refactor
- dialogs ad maincontroller.cs to UI/
- scattered "config loading"
- scattered "loggers"
- message "Configuration reloaded. (Restart required for Migemo and Font settings)."
- for fonts config; i thought is it really available and used? font size and fonts are defined and used from terminal settings and can't be used. in that case we can remove this setting)

* background job dialog: list selected color is same as dialog background and visibility is poor: list color should use 
  -    "ForegroundColor": "White",
  -    "BackgroundColor": "Black",
  -    "HighlightForegroundColor": "Black",
  -    "HighlightBackgroundColor": "Cyan"
* file mask filter dialog: help color should use (DialogHelp[Fore|Back]groundColor)
* wildcard mark dialog: help color should use (DialogHelp[Fore|Back]groundColor)
do not code yet. show me the plans


tabs: when we have many tabs, we cant see tab beyond screnn width. we should introduce a tab selector dialog
tabs: have color for tabs (ActiveTab[Fore|Back]groundColor/InactiveTab[Fore|Back]groundColor/TabbarBackgroundColor)

JobManagerDialog: we need jobid(guid) and which tab the job is in the list: example: "<jobid>:Tab 1[R] job name - 1% (job message)"
JobManagerDialog: close and cancel has save acceralator key 'c': one should be exit or quit?
JobManagerDialog: do we need buttons here? esc closes, select(up/down) and 'k' to kill job, put help at bottom (DialogHelp[Fore|Back]groundColor)

log each file operations to task panel if configured. 

file mask filter dialog: button needed? esc=close, enter=ok
file mask filter dialog: we want match samples list (top 5) in the dialog, list color should use "ForegroundColor","BackgroundColor"

wildcard mark dialog: button needed? esc=close, enter=ok
wildcard mark dialog: we want match samples list (top 5) in the dialog, list color should use "ForegroundColor","BackgroundColor"
wildcard mark dialog:

version number on start, greetings on certain days!

* i want reading progress percentage at textviewer window's '_encodinglabel', like: "Reading... 90%", and when reading finishes, clear _encodinglabel

viewing thousands of files at slow media (SDcard, etc) : Create a high-performance text/binary viewer for TWF (Terminal.Gui v1.19) that handles massive files using
  memory-mapped files, virtual ListView with scrolling, chunked loading (1-4MB), async I/O, line indexing for text,
  efficient terminal rendering, caching (LRU), search optimization, navigation optimization, file type detection, and
  configuration options to maintain Terminal.Gui responsiveness while viewing large files.
* i want progress percentage at main window's '__filenameLabel' rightmost, like: "Loading... 90%", and when finishes, be sure to clear loading indicator


archive can only see filelist inside. copy/move/delete/view doesnt work

readline for c#, for command input, direct move to tabs

Large File Viewer? Some possibilities:
   * Search Optimization: Making the search asynchronous so it doesn't block the UI for GB-sized files, and adding a "Cancel
     Search" option.
   * Horizontal Scrolling: For files with very long lines (like log entries or minified code).
   * Advanced Binary Features: Adding the ability to jump to a specific hex offset or edit bytes.
   * Theme/Colors: Customizing the colors for the line numbers vs. content.
