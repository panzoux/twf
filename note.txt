at starting background job, put jobid(guid) on taskpanel: sample "[Tab 1:] Copy to test2: Started - JobID:0f8fad5b-d9cb-469f-a165-70867728950e"

**to be fixed**


* background job dialog: list selected color is same as dialog background and visibility is poor: list color should use 
  -    "ForegroundColor": "White",
  -    "BackgroundColor": "Black",
  -    "HighlightForegroundColor": "Black",
  -    "HighlightBackgroundColor": "Cyan"
* file mask filter dialog: help color should use (DialogHelp[Fore|Back]groundColor)
* wildcard mark dialog: help color should use (DialogHelp[Fore|Back]groundColor)
do not code yet. show me the plans


tabs: when we have many tabs, we cant see tab beyond screnn width. we should introduce a tab selector dialog
tabs: have color for tabs (ActiveTab[Fore|Back]groundColor/InactiveTab[Fore|Back]groundColor/TabbarBackgroundColor)

JobManagerDialog: we need jobid(guid) and which tab the job is in the list: example: "<jobid>:Tab 1[R] job name - 1% (job message)"
JobManagerDialog: close and cancel has save acceralator key 'c': one should be exit or quit?
JobManagerDialog: do we need buttons here? esc closes, select(up/down) and 'k' to kill job, put help at bottom (DialogHelp[Fore|Back]groundColor)

log each file operations to task panel if configured. 

file mask filter dialog: button needed? esc=close, enter=ok
file mask filter dialog: we want match samples list (top 5) in the dialog, list color should use "ForegroundColor","BackgroundColor"

wildcard mark dialog: button needed? esc=close, enter=ok
wildcard mark dialog: we want match samples list (top 5) in the dialog, list color should use "ForegroundColor","BackgroundColor"
wildcard mark dialog:

version number on start, greetings on certain days!

when deleteing a directory "delete 1 file(s) " dialog is shown. should use proper name and pluralization:
- when deleting file : "1 file"  "2 files"
- when deleting directory : "1 directory" "2 directories"
- when deleting 1 file and 2 directories : "2 directories, 1 file"

viewing large files takes time. if the file is over 1M read and view file partially

archive can only see filelist inside. copy/move/delete/view doesnt work

readline for c#, for command input, direct move to tabs
