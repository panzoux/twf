Install cmigemo:
Windows: Download from KaoriYa
Linux: sudo apt-get install cmigemo
macOS: brew install cmigemo
Run TWF and check logs for "Migemo search enabled"
Use search mode (Ctrl+S) with romaji to find Japanese files

fix: "dict/utf8/migemo-dict" replace "++" with "\+\+" so that we can search "c"

Non-Reloadable Settings (Requires Restart)
Migemo: Dictionary path and enabled status.
Logging: Log level and providers.

when deleteing a directory "delete 1 file(s) " dialog is shown. should use proper name and pluralization:
- when deleting file : "1 file"  "2 files"
- when deleting directory : "1 directory" "2 directories"
- when deleting 1 file and 2 directories : "2 directories, 1 file"

* Job Progress Refinement:
  - Separate progress stats and filename in JobManagerDialog.
  - Implement recursive file counting for accurate "1/N" progress.
  - Display per-file percentage separately from overall job percentage.
  - Fix "1/1" indexing issue for directory copies.

* Log Persistence:
  - Implement log flushing to file when memory buffer exceeds limit.
  - Save task log on application exit.
  - Manual "Save Log" command.

* Visual Enhancements:
  - Resize JobManagerDialog to 64x24.
  - Implement SmartTruncate for filenames with extensions.
  - Configurable Ellipsis ("...").
  - Colored logs in TaskStatusView (OK/FAIL/WARN).
  - Short Job ID display.

viewing large files takes time.
change textviewer, and binaryviewer(may be independent from textviewer so that i can enhance features):
* a high-performance text/binary viewer for massive files (GB+) that uses memory-mapped files, lazy loading
  with chunked reading (1-4MB), virtual scrolling, caching strategy (LRU), async I/O, line indexing for text files,
  efficient data structures (rope/gap buffers), optimized search (Boyer-Moore), UI optimization (double-buffering),
  configurable limits, file type detection, and background processing to ensure responsive operation with large
  files.
* "Esc to stop reading" in taskpanel or asynchronous dialog(continue/cancel) if it takes >10 sec, and allow stop reading 

* textviewer
- if text<1page and TextViewer.PageDown clears the screen. it should stay as there are no more page

* drive dialog:
 - cant select "C:\ xxx" when typing "c" but can select when "c:". why?
 - dont add to drive if the path was unreachable

* refactor
- dialogs ad maincontroller.cs to UI/
- scattered "config loading"
- scattered "loggers"
- message "Configuration reloaded. (Restart required for Migemo and Font settings)."
- for fonts config; i thought is it really available and used? font size and fonts are defined and used from terminal settings and can't be used. in that case we can remove this setting)

* background job dialog: list selected color is same as dialog background and visibility is poor: list color should use 
  -    "ForegroundColor": "White",
  -    "BackgroundColor": "Black",
  -    "HighlightForegroundColor": "Black",
  -    "HighlightBackgroundColor": "Cyan"
* file mask filter dialog: help color should use (DialogHelp[Fore|Back]groundColor)
* wildcard mark dialog: help color should use (DialogHelp[Fore|Back]groundColor)

* display sort order in taskpanel. 
* sort dialog?

* i want reading progress percentage at textviewer window's '_encodinglabel', like: "Reading... 90%", and when reading finishes, clear _encodinglabel

* search ^k clear input

* folder size: dialog? taskpanel? => background job. taskpanel can scroll up

* viewing thousands of files at slow media (SDcard, etc) : Create a high-performance filelist that handles millions of files using
  memory-mapped files, virtual ListView with scrolling, chunked loading (1-4MB), async I/O, line indexing for text,
  efficient terminal rendering, caching (LRU), search optimization, navigation optimization, file type detection, and
  configuration options to maintain Terminal.Gui responsiveness while viewing large files.
* i want progress percentage at main window's '__filenameLabel' rightmost, like: "Loading... 90%", and when finishes, be sure to clear loading indicator

Large File Viewer? Some possibilities:
   * Search Optimization: Making the search asynchronous so it doesn't block the UI for GB-sized files, and adding a "Cancel
     Search" option.
   * Horizontal Scrolling: For files with very long lines (like log entries or minified code).

on quit, if there are any tabs/panes that are in the archive, go back to filesystem, select archive, then quit. when 'leftpane:c:\ rightpane:c:\test\test.zip (virtualfolder)', on quit 'leftpane:c:\ rightpane:c:\test'

"clearmarks"=>
"refreshpane_clearmarks"
"refreshpane_noclearmarks"

we should move twf_errors.log to TWF\logs? where do we keep logs for apps? whats the best practice for win/linux/mac? is %APPDATA%\Roaming\TWF\logs appropriate?

compress dialog: dont show unsupported. 

version number on start

**to be fixed/ideas**

* cancelling "pack to archive" doesnt really stop.

* archive can only see filelist inside. copy/move/delete/view doesnt work (partially done)

* history in jump path dialog? (should go with history?)

* log cleanup script

* remove context menu (for now, as we can make it with custom menu. to be "context" we should have menu for each/certain extensions?)

* on opening editor or running commands, we should show it to the taskstatusview, to let the use know (it looks like it is stuck)

* helper menu for various twf activities

* we shall enhance our help. dynamic help to show defined keybindings with migemo incremental search. we might need another config file for feature/function explanation.(section, function , explanation) (and maybe english/japanese)
that displays formatted content, keybindings from a configuration file, and supports multiple languages. might need HelpView class? some best-practice suggestions, opinions would help

JobManagerDialog: close and cancel has save acceralator key 'c': one should be exit or quit?
JobManagerDialog: do we need buttons here? esc closes, select(up/down) and 'k' to kill job, put help at bottom (DialogHelp[Fore|Back]groundColor)
 

file mask filter dialog: button needed? esc=close, enter=ok
file mask filter dialog: we want match samples list (top 5) in the dialog, list color should use "ForegroundColor","BackgroundColor"

wildcard mark dialog: button needed? esc=close, enter=ok
wildcard mark dialog: we want match samples list (top 5) in the dialog, list color should use "ForegroundColor","BackgroundColor"
wildcard mark dialog:

greetings on certain days!

readline for c#, for command input, direct move to tabs

viewer
   * Advanced Binary Features: Adding the ability to jump to a specific hex offset or edit bytes.
   * Theme/Colors: Customizing the colors for the line numbers vs. content.

ask before delete dialog (file/archive), configurable
