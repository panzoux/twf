# TWF - Two-pane Window Filer

A comprehensive keyboard-driven, dual-pane file manager application for Windows, inspired by the classic AFxW file manager.

## Key Features

- **Dual-Pane Interface**: Effortless file management between two directories.
- **Background Operations**: Non-blocking Copy, Move, and Delete tasks with a real-time progress log and Job Manager.
- **High Performance & Caching**: Asynchronous directory listing with memory-efficient structures and smart caching for instant navigation.
- **Enhanced Tab Management**: Tabbed browsing with horizontal scrolling, custom colors, and a filterable Tab Selector Dialog for high-density workflows.
- **Quick Jump & Autocomplete**: Advanced asynchronous directory and file jump with multi-keyword "AND" logic, ignore lists, and Migemo support. See [JUMP_SEARCH.md](JUMP_SEARCH.md) for details.
- **Power User Tools**: Custom macro-based functions, wildcard marking, and regex filtering.
- **Archive Support**: Full 7-Zip integration. Browse and extract multiple formats (7z, ZIP, LZH, RAR, TAR, etc.) as virtual folders.
