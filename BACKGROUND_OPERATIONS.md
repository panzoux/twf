# Background Operations System

TWF supports non-blocking background file operations. This allows you to perform long-running tasks like copying thousands of files while continuing to browse and manage files in other tabs or panes.

## Key Features

- **Non-blocking Execution**: Copy, Move, Delete, and Directory Size operations run in background threads.
- **Task Panel**: A scrollable log area at the bottom of the screen.
- **Job Manager**: A dedicated dialog (`Ctrl+J`) to monitor, manage, and cancel active jobs.
- **Indeterminate Tasks**: Operations with unknown totals (like directory scanning) display real-time counts and sizes without a misleading 0% progress bar.
- **Safe Collision Handling**: File collisions (Overwrite/Skip) pause only the specific background job, requesting user input without freezing the rest of the application.
- **Performance Optimized**: Progress updates are throttled (respecting `FileListRefreshIntervalMs`) to ensure low CPU usage.

## User Interface

### 1. Task Panel (Log View)
Located at the bottom of the main window. 
- **Collapsed Mode**: Displays only the single most recent log entry.
- **Expanded Mode**: Shows a scrollable history of all operation logs.
- **Directory Info**: Calculating folder size (via **H** key) reports final results here: `[Size] MyFolder: 1.2 GB (10,500 files, 450 folders)`.
- **Note**: This view is focused strictly on file operations and critical system messages. Minor UI events (like marking or simple navigation) are logged silently to the debug file.

### 2. Job Manager Dialog
Accessed via `Ctrl+J`, this dialog provides a detailed list of all background jobs and allows for manual cancellation.

### 3. Tab Busy Indicators
Active jobs are indicated directly in the tab bar using animated spinners (slashes). The number of slashes represents the number of active jobs in that tab.
- **Example**: `[1:Docs *|Backup ]//` indicates Tab 1 has 2 background operations running.
